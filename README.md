Branching Strategy
-> Git Flow Branch Strategy. 
It is a strategy that is best used for smaller teams and projects. The main branch would contain the production-ready code and all other branches (feature branches) would contain bug fixes and improvements. Releases and cycles are frequent for faster feedback for quicker fixes to problems.

.gitignore file
-> the .gitignore contains a list of the files that Git should ignore when commiting to a GitHub repository. This is useful when slimming down commits by excluding things such as build files or packages that are added to a project (instead just commit the file that specifies what packages must be installed).

Storage of credentials and sensitive information
-> You can create secrets as encrypted environment variables that reside in an organization, repository, or repository environment. These variables will contain any secret variables that you might want to store but hide such as API keys or decryption keys.
